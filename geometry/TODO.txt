Write templates for:
1. Geometry objects (points, lines, polygons)
2. Distance calculations (point to point, point to line, point to polygon)
3. Geometric transformations (translation, rotation, scaling)
4. Area calculations (triangle, polygon)
5. Intersection algorithms (line-line, line-polygon, polygon-polygon)
6. Convex hull algorithms (Graham scan, Jarvis march)
7. Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulation
8. Spatial partitioning (quadtrees, k-d trees)
9. Geometric predicates (point in polygon, point on line)
10. Geometric hashing
